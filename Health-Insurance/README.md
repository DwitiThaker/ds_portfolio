## Overview
This project predicts **annual medical expenditure** for a **health insurance company** based on customer demographics using **Linear Regression**.  
The model helps in **risk assessment**, **premium pricing**, and **customer segmentation**.

---

## Problem Statement
Health insurance companies must forecast customer medical costs to manage financial risk.  
Using customer features like **age**, **BMI**, and **smoking habits**, we predict **annual medical charges**.

---

## Dataset Description
- **Features:**
  - `Age`: Customer’s age.
  - `BMI`: Body Mass Index.
  - `Smoking Status`: Smoker or Non-Smoker.
  - `Other Factors`: Gender, children, region, etc.
- **Target:**
  - `Annual Medical Expenditure`

## Methodology
- Data Loading and Exploration
- Preprocessing (if needed)
- Train-Test Splitting
- Building a **Linear Regression** model with `scikit-learn`
- Prediction and Visualization
- Model Evaluation (Optional)

---

## Results
- Built a baseline **Linear Regression model**.
- Identified key trends (e.g., smokers have higher expenses).
- Simple but meaningful prediction performance.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso).
- Engineer new features (e.g., age groups, BMI categories).
- Try ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Conduct advanced EDA and feature importance analysis.
